### Summary
This was my first attempt at using React for anything other than Hello World, and it was pretty cool! I relied heavily on the docs that FB provides. The most helpful was definitely http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html

As suggested in the reading above, it was really helpful to draw out the component hierarchy before coding to start thinking about responsibilities for state, and how components might interact with one another. Here is a simple diagram I made to help myself get started:
